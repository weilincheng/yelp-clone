# yelp-clone

I am following the [PERN Stack Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU&t=4481s) to learn how to build a Yelp clone by using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. 

Course developed by [Sanjeev Thiyagarajan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2sYgV-NV6S5_-pqLGChoNQ).

## Day2
Install dotenv and nodemon. Tested get method which sends a json format back. 
Added three api:
* Get all restaurants
* Get individual restaurants
* Create new restaurants

## Day1
Install the node environment and install express.
